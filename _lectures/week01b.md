Today's discussion section is an opportunity to continue the work from the previous class, and to **help ensure that everyone on the team** is done with jpa00 and jpa01.

Please understand that even if **you** are done with installation jpa00 and jpa01, you **need to show up** to help your fellow team members.  You have a stake in ensuring that everyone on the team is up to speed and ready to help contribute.

So please do come to class, and help your fellow team members.

If/when **all six** team members are done with jpa00 and jpa01, you may leave early, but only then.
