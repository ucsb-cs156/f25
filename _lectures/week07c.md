Three things your team needs to do TODAY:

1. Do your CATME evals. Do them NOW.  Don't put it off.
   
   They are due 11:59pm Friday, but if you put it off, you'll forget.

   See your EMAIL for link to that, or login at <https://catme.org> with your cgaucho@ucsb.edu email address.

2. Decide when you are going to do your next retro: must be either Today, next Tuesday, or some time outside of class in bewteen.

   If today, tell me ASAP so that I can be sure the document gets set up for you.

   You can also do it next Tuesday, or outside of class any time between now and next Tuesday.

3. Decide whether you are going to do the reflection activity in the slack channel TODAY, or whether you are going to choose another day.

   If you choose another day, you MUST make a PR before the end of class today: see instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wLRWv3-nKdhsValX8Vsx1CoFrbCKgYHTY-nib722Df0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ha1h6ey1po9j) or in the link on your team channel.


Then, work on your issues.
