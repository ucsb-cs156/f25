## Start with Standup (aka "Daily Scrum")

Make a post in your team slack channel answering the three standup questions:
* What have you finished since last standup?
* What are you working on now?
* Are you stuck on anything, or blocked by anything?

When you see that everyone that is present has made a post in the channel (including anyone attending remotely via zoom), 
invite everyone to stand, and read out their post to the group.

Take note of anyone that's missing; `@` them on the slack channel, and ask them to make a standup post as soon as they get an opportunity.

## Work on team01, or start on team02

If your team is ready to start on [team02](https://ucsb.instructure.com/courses/25659/assignments/348165), please do so.
