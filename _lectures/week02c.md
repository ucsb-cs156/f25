# {{page.title}} - {{page.description}}

Today, our entire class period is devoted to this activity:

* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f25/hwk/p06>

We will not be taking programming questions until after your group has submitted this activity on Canvas, and certainly not before 6pm.

However, we do have office hours from 6:15 to 7:15pm if you have questions
about the programming assignments that are currently available to work on (jpa02, jpa03).

# A note about jpa04

If you are done with jpa00,jpa01, jpa02, and jpa03 and would like to try jpa04, you may; it's available. 

However, the instructions ask you not to start yet, because we haven't completely finished the autograder.  So, be advised that while you can start, the autograder might not give you the "final score"; we may add additional checks to the autograder before we officially release the assignment.
