## Today's work

Today, we'll work on 

* [p05](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/hwk/p05.html)

Then continue with:

* [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/jpa00.html)
* [jpa01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/jpa01.html)
* [jpa02](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/jpa02.html)
* [jpa03](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/jpa03.html)

You should work independently, but also help other folks on your team as/when they get stuck on things.

So if you finish early, before you just "leave", check in both in person and on slack with the other members of your team to see if any of them need help.

Please leave only if/when you're done with *all of these*, **and** no one on your team needs help.
