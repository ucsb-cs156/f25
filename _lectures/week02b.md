Today, we started [jpa03](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f25/lab/jpa03.html).

This message was posted to the slack before class:

> Hello Everyone!  Here's the plan for section today:
> 
> * Work on jpa02 if you don't yet have 100 points on Gradescope.
> * Otherwise, start jpa03.
> 
> If you aren't done with jpa01, work on that first (that's just two students, as far as I know).
> 
> Please get as far as you can with both jpa02 and jpa03 today, and use this opportunity to get help from the staff.
> 
> We will be doing a different activity in lecture tomorrow, one that does require your attendance/participation, and the whole team to be present, and there won't be time to get help with programming tasks until office hours (6:15-7:15).
