# {{page.title}} - {{page.descripion}}

Today:
* Research Survey and Informed Consent Briefing
* Standup on team01 if needed
* Be sure that everyone on the team has done at least one code review
  * If not, you may need to do a code review on a merged PR ([here's how](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/code_reviews/reviewing_a_merged_PR.html))
* Starting team02


## No shows?

Note: if anyone on your team that has unfinished work on team01 is a no-show today (in the sense that they are not in contact with the team at all, and so the team is blocked), please contact the instructor **immediately**.
* The sooner we address issues such as those, the more options we have, and the less dire the consequences for all concerned.  
* The longer we put it off, the fewer options we have, and worse the outcomes are for everyone.


## Informed Consent Survey

* [Slides]({{page.slides}})

Prof. Conrad, together with three other professors from Oregon State, Washington State, and Chico State (California) are conducting research related to Software Engineering courses such as CMPSC 156.

Today, we are asking you fill out a survey related to this research as a homework assignment ({{page.pre_survey_hwk}})

You can read about the study here: <{{page.informed_consent_briefing}}>

Note that you will be asked, as part of the survey, whether we may use your answers for research, meaning publications that are submitted to conferences and journals and available to the scientific community. We hope you will say yes to this, but you are *free to say no, with no adverse consequeces* to your grade. 

### Confidentiallity is protected

**Neither Prof. Conrad, nor anyone at UC Santa Barbara** will see your answers to the survey until after the course is over.  We are **only** provided with whether or not you completed the survey.  Nothing more.

**After** the course is over, we are provided with your answers.  We keep your data confidential, and when reporting data, team and individual names are anonymized.

## Where is the link to the pre-survey?

* On Canvas under H02

# CATME evaluation

You will be getting a email reminders to complete a CATME survey at <https://catme.org> which is the first of several "peer evaluations".  This is an opportunity to reflect on how things are going in your team.    

Completing this survey by midnight Wednesday counts as a homework grade.   If I have to extend the deadline past 11:59 Wednesday for anyone, it will result in a significant penalty, so please just do it today, right after you finish the pre-survey.

## Starting team02/team03

The instructions for team02 and team03 are now posted.

Both team02 and team03 will be done with the same repos and Kanban boards.

## Due Dates for team01/team02/team03

Due dates for team01/team02/team03 are all posted on Canvas.  Canvas is the *single source of truth* for these due dates.

The due date for team01 and team02 can slip, but the due date for team03 **cannot slip** since we need weeks 07,08,09,10 for the legacy code project.


# Getting started on team02

As with team01, for team02, there are six database tables.

You can work on the same ones, or change it up; that's up to you.

In any case, please divide up the tables among the team, one per team member.

I suggest that you do this on your team slack channel in a single post, and then "pin" that post to your channel.

That post might look something like this:

```
Adam:  Articles
Brianna: Menu Item Reviews
Chris:  Help Requests
Danny: Recommendation Requests
Erin: UCSB Organizations
Fay: UCSB Dining Commons Menu Items
```

# Looking ahead to Wednesday/Thursday.

On Wednesday, whether you are finished or not with team01, your team needs to at least do the initial assignment of topics for team02 (it breaks up into six separate subprojects, just like team01 did), and the initial set up tasks on the team's Kanban board.

On Wednesday, ONLY once you've done that, you may ask for help with team01.

(TAs/LAs: On Wednesday, if anyone asks for help with team01, help them but only after they show you that they've claimed a database table for team02, and have assigned themselves at least one issue for that table in the In Progress column.")

## There will not be time Thursday to work on team02

Thursday, we'll be doing our first Retrospective (a retro on team01).  That will take the entire class period.

There will be time during Prof. Conrad's office hours starting at 6:15pm, but we will not help with team01 or team02 *during* class on Thursday.


# Looking ahead to next Thursday

This Thursday's class will be devoted to a different team activity, the one that I consider to be the most important part of the Agile software process: Retrospectives.    Please do be on time for class Thursday, in person 
if possible, and plan to give your full attention to that activity
for the entire class.

There will NOT be any time to work on programming assignments
or get help in class 

To prepare for this activity, please read this article:
