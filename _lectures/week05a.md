## Start with Standup (aka "Daily Scrum")

By now, you should know the drill, but if not, you can click the triangle for more details:

<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1">Daily Standup details</summary>
Make a post in your team slack channel answering the three standup questions:
* What have you finished since last standup?
* What are you working on now?
* Are you stuck on anything, or blocked by anything?

When you see that everyone that is present has made a post in the channel (including anyone attending remotely via zoom), 
invite everyone to stand, and read out their post to the group.

Take note of anyone that's missing; `@` them on the slack channel, and ask them to make a standup post as soon as they get an opportunity.

## You shoud be done with team01

If your team isn't finished with team01, your team is behind.  If you need help, please reach out to the staff and let us know how we can support you.

## Please work on team02

Please be sure that you review the Kanban board at least once a day (e.g. when it is posted to your team slack channel), and make sure that:
* you have at least one issue in the "in progress" column
* ideally, you have *exactly* one issue in the "in progress" column
* that you are helping your team to get code reviews merged.
