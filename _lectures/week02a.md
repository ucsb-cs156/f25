Today, we started [jpa02](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f25/lab/jpa02.html).

This message was posted to the slack before class:

> jpa02 is now available for you to start working on.
> 
> If you are able to finish it before class, you still do need to come to class to see if anyone else on your team needs help, but once everyone is done with it, your team is done for today.
> 
> Be advised though, that this one is a bit more challenging that jpa00 and jpa01, so it might take you some time to get through.   All the more reason to get started early, so that when class starts today, you'll be ready with your questions.
