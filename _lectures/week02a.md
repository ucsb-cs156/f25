## Reminder: Please read Listening To Developers for tomorrow

For tomorrow: please read the Listening to Developers Paper:
* <https://pconrad.github.io/files/paper028.pdf>


It was supposed to be for today, but we need one more day to get the team repos 
set up for it.

## The individual stuff will end soon

The last couple of lecture haven't had much team interaction in them, but
we are getting close to the stage where *everything* will start being done in teams.

So please let your team know if you will be late, missing, etc.  Don't "just disappear", even if you are all caught up on work.

## Today's work

Today, we'll work on 

* [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/jpa00.html)
* [jpa01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/jpa01.html)
* [jpa02](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/jpa02.html)
* [jpa03](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/jpa03.html)

You should work independently, but also help other folks on your team as/when they get stuck on things.

So if you finish early, before you just "leave", check in both in person and on slack with the other members of your team to see if any of them need help.

And please stay and work on all three of these; leave only when you're done with *all of these*, **and** no one on your team needs help.
