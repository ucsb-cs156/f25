Today, we'll work on 

* [jpa00](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/jpa00.html)
* [jpa01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/jpa01.html)
* [jpa02](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/jpa02.html)

You should work independently, but also help other folks on your team as/when they get stuck on things.

So if you finish early, before you just "leave", check in both in person and on slack with the other members of your team to see if any of them need help.

And please stay and work on all three of these; leave only when you're done with *all three*, **and** no one on your team needs help.
