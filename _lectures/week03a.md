## Reminder about [`#help-lecture-discussion`]({{site.slack_help_lecture_discussion}}) 
Reminder that during class, you should use the [`#help-lecture-discussion`]({{site.slack_help_lecture_discussion}}) channel when you need help from the staff.   This allows us to get to everyone in a fair way (first-come, first served), and also to ensure that the member of the staff with the most knowledge about your issue is the one that comes over.
