## CATME reminder

You will be getting a email reminders to complete a CATME survey at <https://catme.org> which is the first of several "peer evaluations".  This is an opportunity to reflect on how things are going in your team.    

Completing this survey by midnight Wednesday counts as a homework grade.   If I have to extend the deadline past 11:59 Wednesday for anyone, it will result in a significant penalty, so if you didn't do it yet, please do it RIGHT NOW.

## Please look over the material on Retros before tomorrow

Before tomorrow's class, please look over the lecture summary here, and read over the linked material about retros: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lectures/week05b/>

This article, especially: [Agile Retros](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html)


## Rest of class

* Standup meeting (on Slack, and out loud)
* Get team02 set up if you haven't yet (even if team isn't done with team01)
* Work on team02 (or team01 if not done)

## Do not work on team01 today unless/until team02 is setup

Before you ask for help with team01, or work on team01, please *at least* get your kanban board set up for team02  assign yourself the first issue, and drag it to "in progress".

Please assign yourself all of the other issues related to your database table as well.
