Today in lecture:

P07:  Make a post on the team slack channel indicating

* Your status with jpa03 (done, or if not done, what step you are on, and when you expect to finish)
* Claim one of the six database tables listed in team01 as the one youâ€™ll work on.

Then: work on either finishing jpa03, or starting team01.

Team01 is here: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/team01.html>
