# Introducing Today's Team Activity

Today's participation activity is a team activity, but you'll be graded on your individual contribution to that.

It involves two items:
* your individual role in populating a [Kanban board](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/kanban/) for team01, as explained below.
* setting up your individual dev deployment on team01 on dokku (you have until tomorrow to do this, but you should start today.)

Here are links to the kanban boards; take a look now.  There are more instructions below.

## Repos for team01

Here are the links to the repos and Kanban (project) boards for team01

{% include team01_repos.md %}

Again: while this is a team activity, you'll be graded on your participation individually.

# Step 0: Big Picture

Here's the big picture for team01:

* The team01 starter code has examples of Java code for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) for three database tables.
* Each of the six members of your team will take on adding the CRUD operations for one more such table.
* Full instructions for team01 here: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s25/lab/team01.html>

Today's work is to set up a Kanban board for you to track your efforts on the team01 project.

# Step 1: Make sure every team member has access to the board

Each team member should make sure they can bring up the team's Kanban board.

You can do this by making a post on your team's slack channel.

To reduce noise in the channel:
* The first person should post "I can access the team kanban board at" (then post the link).
* Everyone else can add a reply to that thread with "me too" or "I'm having trouble".

# Step 2: Decide who is doing which of the apps


Start reading the instructions for team01.  You'll see that you are going to be dividig up 
six database tables.   You need to agree on a division, and make a post to your slack channel like this one:

   ```
   Adam:  Articles
   Brianna: Menu Item Reviews
   Chris:  Help Requests
   Danny: Recommendation Requests
   Erin: UCSB Organizations
   Fay: UCSB Dining Commons Menu Items
   ```

Decide which of these you want to work, and make a Slack post on your team channel claiming that database table.  Then someone should collect those all into a post like the one above.

# Step 3: Assign at least one issue to yourself

Look either in the Issues list for your repo (the `Issues` tab) or in the `To Do` column on the Kanban board, and find the issue `Create personal dokku dev deployment` for your database table.

This will be the first issue you work on.

Here's what it looks like to assign an issue to an individual (this is a different project, but it illustrates the mechanics):

![assign-issues-individually](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/233480831-3698fe62-ef40-40b1-bb6e-67bb752b4d35.gif)

When the team is done, each member of the entire team should be assigned to at least one issue.

# Step 4: Drag the issue you assigned to yourself into the In Progress column

Now drag this issue *and only this issue* from ToDo into In Progress.

The idea is that from now until your full team is finished with all of team01, ideally, each team member is assigned to exactly one issue in the in-progress column (no more, and no less), until the team is done.

Note that even when you are finished with all of your issues, *your reponsibility to the full team is not over*, and you *still need to come to class and participate*.  If you finish first, at that point, your responsibility is to be a resource to the rest of the team to help them.  This may take many forms:

* Reviewing and merging their pull requests
* Dividing up your subteam and pairing with members that are running into problems or are stuck.

Completing all of the issues in your team's `ToDo` column can be considered a single *sprint* (we'll talk later about *sprints*, which is a term commonly used in Agile Software Development.)

# Finishing and Submitting

Now check that 
* each team member has posted on the Slack channel that they have access to the Kanban board
* each team member has claimed one database table and has posted *that* on the team slack channel
* each team member has assigned themselves the `personal dev dokku deployment` issue for that database table
* each team member has dragged that issue into the "In Progress" column on the Kanban board.

Once all team members have completed the steps above, one team member should submit P06 on Canvas.

If any team members have not yet completed P06, please get in touch with them; if necessary, complete the steps on their behalf so that the team doesn't lose points.  (But do let your team member know that you did that.)


# What then?

* If not finished with H01 and/or jpa03, jpa04, finish those up.
* If done with those, start your work on team01

# Grading checklist for participation activity:

| Pts | Step | Item |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | Step 1  | All team members made post indicating they can access Kanban board |
| 30 | Step 2  | Slack post claiming an item for each team member |
| 30 | Step 3  | Each team member is assigned to at least one issue on the Kanban board   |
| 30 | Step 4  | Each team member has *exactly one* issue in the ToDo column on the Kanban board |
