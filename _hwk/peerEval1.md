This homework grade is to complete your CATME peer evaluation by the published deadline.  

Reminders get made
* On Slack, multiple times
* In lecture on Thursday
* By email from CATME, multiple times.

If you completed it by the deadline, {{ page.due | date: '%A %B %d %Y at %l:%M%p' }},  *including writing actual thoughtful comments about the work of each of your peers* you'll get a grade of 100/100.

If you completed it by the deadline, but your comments are something generic that is copy and pasted 5 times like:

```
Alice is doing a great job!
Bob is doing a great job!
Charlene is doing a great job!
David is doing a great job!
Erica is doing a great job!
```

Then your grade will be at most 80/100 (i.e. a 20 point deduction for "phoning it in".)

Grades between 80 and 100 are at the instructors discretion based on the degree to which your feedback shows thoughtful consideration.

If you fail to complete it by the deadline and the instructions has to reopen submissions, your grade is subject to deductions at the instructor's discretion.

Note that for grades in the "homework" category, unlike the "participation" grades, there are no "dropped" scores.
