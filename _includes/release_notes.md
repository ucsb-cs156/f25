# Release Notes

You are required to prepare a set of release notes as a team.

Please prepare these as a Google Drive document in the same folder where you do your retros.

Please call the file `s25-xx-release-notes`.

Please include the name of your team and a link to your repo at the top of the page,
along with the names of the members of your team.


## What goes in the release notes

The release notes should summarize:
* For the actual *users* of the application, a summary of what changes they notice from the way the app was at the start of the course to now.
* In a separate, shorter section: for the *developers* of the application, a summary of any additional changes devs may need to be aware of.
* It does not have to be every single last detail of every change; it should focus on the big picture of things users/developers would need or want to know. 
* Before and after screenshots can be helpful.

## Samples

You can find samples of release notes at these links:

* [proj-courses](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-courses/tree/main/docs/release-notes)
* [proj-dining](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-dining/tree/main/docs/release-notes)
* [proj-rec](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-rec/tree/main/docs/release-notes)

We do not have any samples for Frontiers since this is the first quarter that CS156 teams have worked on proj-frontiers.

## How to submit

Work colletively on this as a team.   When finished, submit a link to either your Google Drive doc on Canvas under the assignment `ReleaseNotes`

For the due date, refer to the Release Notes assignment on Canvas.
